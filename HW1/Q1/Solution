For Question1, it is required for us to read 10 temperature values from the temperature sensor of our board. 
In order to achieve this, Under STM32F746G datasheet, we can see under Section 2.40 on page 43 that thermal sensor is connected to ADC Channel 1.
Using ADC Channel 1 by using the function, temp_sensor(ADC_TEMP); we recieve the voltage value generated by ADC, which depends on the temperature.
From there, we use adc_ratio, which is a value between 0 and 1, and we multiply it with 3.3 V in order to get the actual voltage.
In the datasheet the following formula is given:

Vsensed = V25 + (T - 25) x AvgSlope

From this function, we derive:

T = (Vsensed-V25)/AvgSlope + 25

Vsensed is the read voltage value from the sensor.
V25 is the corresponding voltage value to the temperature 25 degrees celcius.
AvgSlope is amount of change in voltage depending on 1 degrees celcius change, which corresponds to 2.5 mV or 0.0025V per degrees celcius.
Thus we get the function:

float temperature = ((voltage - 0.76f) / 0.0025f) + 25.0f;

In order to print the values, we would use floating point in printf() function. But compiling the program with the newlib nano version causes no floating point support when using printf().
We've overcome this problem by seperating the end value to integer and fraction. We force type conversion on the integer part and subtract it in order to use the fraction part.
